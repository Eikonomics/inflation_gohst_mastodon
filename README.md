# inflation_gohst_mastodon
This is my first mastodon bot. It is based on my semi-retired Twitter bot of the same name

ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
The idea behind this bott is simple:
1. download Icelandic CPI data, both the overall CPI and sub-indexes (the indexes that make up the CPI)
2. Select CPI and one random product category from the sub-indexes
3. see what has happend in the last 2 years to the price of those things. 
  3a. produce a chart showing the development, i.e. the product category relative to the overall CPI
  3b. write some text based on the data.
4. post the analysis on Mastodon, @verdbolgudraugurinn@xn--lofll-1sat.is
